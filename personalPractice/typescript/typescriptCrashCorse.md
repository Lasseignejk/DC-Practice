# TypeScript Crash Course

An open source language; a superset of JavaScript(it has everything JS does + more)

Typescript...

1. Offers additional features to JavaScript including static types
2. Can be used for frontend JS as well as backend with Node.js

## Dynamic vs Static Typing

- In dynamically typed languages, the types are associated with run-time values and not named explicitly in your code
- In statically typed languages, you explicitly assign types to variables, function aprameters, return values, etc

Static Examples: Java, C, C++, Rust, Go
Dynamic Examples: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP

## Pros

- More robust
- Easily spot bugs
- Predictability
- Readability
- Popular

## Cons

- More code to write
- More to learn
- Required compilation
- Not true static typing

Typescript shines in group projects, or larger projects

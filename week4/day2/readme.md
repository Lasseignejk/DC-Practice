# Variables

you can define a variable in three ways: let, var, and const.

## let

let is used to define a variable that you can reassign.

## const

same as let, but it stands for constant. It can only be what you define it. You CAN redefine it, but you CAN'T change the data type. So if you define it as a string, you can redefine it, but only as a different string. Recommended to make most variables consts.
